##Requirements:

One user may have several projects

Each task must have a description, creation date and finish date
The user needs to have a simple option to mark the tasks as completed when accessing the task list
Each task should have its termination date visible as a tooltip, if available, and some visual way of identifying its status
A task that was defined as finished should not be edited nor removed
When a task or Project is added our deleted, the page should not fully refresh, so that users have a good experience
##Non funcional requirements

The application should be written in Javascript.
The application backend should be written in Node.js or GoLang.
The authentication and registration layers should be coded and not based on pre-existing modules (such as Passport).
For the frontend, javascript frameworks can be used (Angular, React, Polymer or others).
Components should be used to promote increased code reusage (react or angular components, webcomponents or other alternatives)
